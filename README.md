# Self-Sustaibale User Interface(SSUI)

SSUI is a music player prototype. The prototype aims to understand user’s most favored features as well as the user’scurrent mood by capturing specific user actions and based on those actions, adapt to the users predicted preferred state. The adaptation process will enhance the overall experience for the user and alleviate the elimination of the iterative prototype designprocess for the developer.
